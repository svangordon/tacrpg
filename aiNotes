AI Procedure:

AI will have two levels: "squad" and "individual". Go through all of the squads,
determine the squads priorities, and then apply these to the individuals. I think
that this works, b/c we don't really want a super cohesive plan from the monsters;
they're not soldiers after all. Or I mean maybe they can have plans, but some of
them are just monsters. Okay. So I think that we have a few predefined behaviors:

individuals:
  --Hunt
  --Lurk
  --Wander

Squads:
  --Patrol
  --Attack
  --Defend
  --Rest/Loiter

That sounds pretty good. So there's going to be an AI reducer. startAiTurn should
fire; MW adds a constructed AI data object to the action. Wait, the MW actually
is going to have to do a lot of this. So the event fires, the MW makes the data
obj. then in MW, loop over

Question: does it make more sense to store the info on the units, etc, in the units
object? no. Let's store that all in the AI reducer. We'll have an 'init AI' action


-- Fire event that triggers AI, then:

1) maybe check for really important things that need to be taken care of immediately:
  a. immediate win
  b. immediate loss
  c. but then again maybe not
2)
