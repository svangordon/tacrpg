combat system:

(What do i like about FE? I like the RPS nature of it. But not as much as I like
Banner Saga!)

Ah, okay, logical extension of the idea: The player controls a party of adventurers,
making its way through a series of linked portals, heading to the bottom of the dungeon
or hell or whatever to fight satan or whatever. Game over on TPK, but option to
get more party members b/w stages. Light RPG elements (xp, levelling, items, etc)

Thoughts on stats:

Like banner saga,
{
  strength: how much damage dealt; lowered by hp loss,
  hp: damage until death,
  armor: reduces hp damage, lowered by break,
  speed: every 2 points of > speed reduces str by 1?
}

game idea:
  -- Have the heroes be constantly reincarnated. Like the heroes aren't themselves
  aware of it, but like if you have a good fighter, and your fighter dies, you
  get a new fighter with similar stats / abilities. Maybe your human is now a dwarf
  or your healer is now a mage. Or maybe you get a totally random new hero? I like that
  too.
