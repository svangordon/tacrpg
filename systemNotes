combat system:

(What do i like about FE? I like the RPS nature of it. But not as much as I like
Banner Saga!)

Ah, okay, logical extension of the idea: The player controls a party of adventurers,
making its way through a series of linked portals, heading to the bottom of the dungeon
or hell or whatever to fight satan or whatever. Game over on TPK, but option to
get more party members b/w stages. Light RPG elements (xp, levelling, items, etc)

Thoughts on stats:

Like banner saga,
{
  strength: how much damage dealt; lowered by hp loss,
  hp: damage until death,
  armor: reduces hp damage, lowered by break,
  speed: every 2 points of > speed reduces str by 1?
}

Gameplay idea:
-- Each level is themed-ish, with one or two different kinds of enemies,
a 'target' and a 'boss', both of which can be avoided (or maybe you have to do them?
that makes more sense.) The levels can be maybe procedurally generated, but more
likely not. Go for a goofy-serious retro kind of schtick.  Kind of like endless
quest levels from nethack. Idea: have different kinds of missions (survive n turns,
kill the rat king, escort vip). One map per mission type, and then you can skin
over it

Game idea: Something like "we become what we behold", but w/o the shitty moral at the end
like you're a news editor, and you have to make decisions about what you do or don't
publish, dealing with pressures like you want to keep your job.
