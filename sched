Goal:

build a simple strategy game within one week. You're shooting for basically a clone of The Banner Saga. Grid-based, turn-based, with that pleasant system of armor vs hp. Oh, and Str being HP. liked that too. Rip that too.

MVP:

-- Display a map with different units on it
  -- Map, units, grid

-- Clickable map to move units around.

-- Different units

-- Rudimentary computer opponent

TODO:
-- COMPLETE 11/9: Basic, static map, which just displays a grid of boxes
-- COMPLETE 11/9: Make tiles capable of displaying different backgrounds depending on 'type'
-- TODO 11/9: Create a unit reducer, or other way to store data about units on the map
  -- Probably related is going to be some actions:
    -- Unit actions are probably going to be fairly important here. attackUnit,
    moveUnit, etc, are going to be unit actions, I think.
    -- prepMap or something like it might be one of them; like update the object that
    the mapComponent reads off of. More likely, though, is going to be having the
    map container watch the units and when those change fire the event to redraw
    the map itself.
  --COMPLETED 11/11

-- TODO 11/12: Have movePath sent to the turnReducer and then dispatched with
a 'processTurn' action.

-- TODO 11/12: Have turns be resolved through a button

-- TODO 11/12: Include actions, most importantly attack

-- TODO 11/12: The BattleMap should be reading off one (and only one!) master map
that is calculated by the bMap container by pulling together a bunch of stuff out
of props and then held in its state

Needed:

-- Attack Resolution
-- Nice looking gui

TODO: Rip stats, combat calculations from FE. Weapons weight? prolly not.

Next

Important things:
-- Good cross browser support, and good mobile support
-- maybe support for one-button gameplay
-- simple gameplay that's easy to pick up
-- if possible, some kind of upgrade sort of deal. or other way to
get the user to keep clicking
-- nice looking level of polish
-- idea: the player plays as the leaders of various towns as they fight off a
giant horde (or maybe player plays as horde). Earns points based on how well
they do before they get destroyed (or more likely, for a set number of turns),
spends those points on upgrades. Eventually, they repulse the invaders and start
questing to destroy the horde instead. This sounds like an absolutely exceptional
idea.

todo:
-- Find one or outlets for monetization. Either places I could license it to, or
places I could post it to get paid off of my own adds (and probably jfc use react
to defeat ad blocker, if you can)
-- Look for mongol sprites or whatever
  -- Instead, use sprites from one of the various nethack tilesets.
Pretty good sense of what the final game looks like:
  Player repulses hordes of monsters that come out of the forest (or from the
  mountains, etc.)
  Things needed:
  -- Actual combat mechanics
  -- Way of resolving things dieing
  -- Monster sprites
  -- Terrain

Not to keep tweaking things, but how about every year a group of heroes must fight
back a demonic incursion. Ah, every year, a group of heroes must use a portal to
enter the netherworlds, slay / rescue something, and make it back. Upgrades b/w
missions.

Ah, okay, logical extension of the idea: The player controls a party of adventurers,
making its way through a series of linked portals, heading to the bottom of the dungeon
or hell or whatever to fight satan or whatever. Game over on TPK, but option to
get more party members b/w stages. Light RPG elements (xp, levelling, items, etc)

Thoughts on stats
