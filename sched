Goal:

build a simple strategy game within one week. You're shooting for basically a clone of The Banner Saga. Grid-based, turn-based, with that pleasant system of armor vs hp. Oh, and Str being HP. liked that too. Rip that too.

MVP:

-- Display a map with different units on it
  -- Map, units, grid

-- Clickable map to move units around.

-- Different units

-- Rudimentary computer opponent

TODO:
-- COMPLETE 11/9: Basic, static map, which just displays a grid of boxes
-- COMPLETE 11/9: Make tiles capable of displaying different backgrounds depending on 'type'
-- TODO 11/9: Create a unit reducer, or other way to store data about units on the map
  -- Probably related is going to be some actions:
    -- Unit actions are probably going to be fairly important here. attackUnit,
    moveUnit, etc, are going to be unit actions, I think.
    -- prepMap or something like it might be one of them; like update the object that
    the mapComponent reads off of. More likely, though, is going to be having the
    map container watch the units and when those change fire the event to redraw
    the map itself.
  --COMPLETED 11/11

-- TODO 11/12: Have movePath sent to the turnReducer and then dispatched with
a 'processTurn' action.

-- TODO 11/12: Have turns be resolved through a button

-- TODO 11/12: Include actions, most importantly attack

-- TODO 11/12: The BattleMap should be reading off one (and only one!) master map
that is calculated by the bMap container by pulling together a bunch of stuff out
of props and then held in its state

Needed:

-- Attack Resolution
-- Nice looking gui

TODO: Rip stats, combat calculations from FE. Weapons weight? prolly not.
